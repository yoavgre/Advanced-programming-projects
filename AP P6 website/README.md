<p>i added a small game. when the website is done loading, a football appears, when you click in it disappears
for 5 seconds and then appears again in a random position on the screen, if you score a goal an alert pop</p>
<p>the function is at first using event listener for DOMfinishedloading to start, then the ball appears using display:'block',
then the function uses another event listener of 'clickon' the ball. when this event happen the function changes the ball dispaly to none, and 
, uses a helper function that set the position of the ball randomly, and with a delay of 5 seconds shows the ball again. 
at the end it checks if the ball is in the net using getBoundingElement function of both elements</p>
